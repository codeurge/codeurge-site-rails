# README

This is the Rails application that runs codeurge.com; it will be a growing application that is rather humble in it's beginnings. Soon to be implemented is a fully-functional blog.
This project is not intended to be used elsewhere, but merely as a representation of my abilities. However, the code is NOT copyrighted so feel free to do so! (See Unlicense)

# TODO

* Finish Blog functionality
* Write Blog RSpec Tests
* Research passwordless authentication (Thanks heartbleed)
* Cleanup and re-factor code as needed
