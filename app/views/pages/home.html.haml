          There’s a reason music is first on the list, because I simply do not know how I’d function without music. I’m mostly prepared for the zombie apocalypse - but I’d still have to play my vinyls even if it attracts the undead.
          Yeah, I’m one of those people. I love putting on a vinyl and using it to break my programming sessions into ~15-20 minute increments between side flips.
