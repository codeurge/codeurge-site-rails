        %h1 Music
        %p 
          There’s a reason music is first on the list, because I simply do not know how I’d function without music. I’m mostly prepared for the zombie apocalypse - but I’d still have to play my vinyls even if it attracts the undead.
          Yeah, I’m one of those people. I love putting on a vinyl and using it to break my programming sessions into ~15-20 minute increments between side flips.

        %h1 Cycling
        %p Admittedly, I’m rather new to bicycling as an adult. Sure I did it around the neighborhood as a kid - but as an adult I can go places. It’s different than going places in my car; it’s relaxed, surprising, and dynamic - all the while, taking my breath away both literally and figuratively.

        %p 
          I pretend to be an ametur astrophotography every chance I get to drive out to the dark sky site 3 hours outside of Denver. I find that stargazing and photographing the universe can really keep things in perspective.
          %br
          Orion, is my favorite constellation - he’s out right now! Go see for yourself!

        %p Raspberry Pi and other similar hardware really amazes me with the power they pack. I personally own 3 RPi’s, 2 act as 1080p Night Vision Security Cameras, and the third is a 1080p DTS-HD Media Center. Pretty neat for ~$45.
